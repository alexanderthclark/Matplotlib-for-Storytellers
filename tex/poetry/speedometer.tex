There's an allure to control rooms or all the gauges on the dashboard of a vehicle. If you can make your dashboards alluring, your stakeholders will visit them more often. We'll create a simple speedometer-like gauge to add some visual interest to reporting a single percentile value. We'll use what learned about rotating points in Section \ref{subsec:rotations}
The gauge will have values running from 0\% to 100\%, and we'll place these along a half circle. The gauge's hand will point to a particular realized percentile value. We use a rotation matrix to find the correct angle at which to place the hand.

You might prefer to make further modifications to the sizing and spacing depending. Below, we see some crowding with the tick labels.
