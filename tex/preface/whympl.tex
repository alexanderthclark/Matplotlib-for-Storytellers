%These notes are an outgrowth of my general Python for Data Analysis lecture notes, expanding what was covered in under two two-hour lectures to what will take more. 
Though a bit aged, matplotlib is the standard in Python. matplotlib is integrated with pandas and Seaborn is based off matplotlib. You might prefer Plotnine if you already know R's ggplot2. You might prefer to leave Python and use D3 if you know javascript. You might prefer Microsoft Excel if you want consultants in your audience to feel at home.

I recommend matplotlib to anyone who is already committed to working in Python (and with the Python community) and values reproducibility and customizability. By the time we get to Part \ref{part:poetry}, we'll be drawing more than plotting. This allows for more creativity than Excel allows and we'll maintain a reproducible Python-only workflow.
