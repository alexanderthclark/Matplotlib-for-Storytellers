I use Python 3.9 and matplotlib 3.7.1. I also make use of Jupyter notebook cell magics. I assume familiarity with basic Python programming, NumPy, pandas, and even matplotlib. In Part \ref{part:prose}, the premise is that you can make a plot, but now you want to polish it. Other parts assume less background knowledge. For those needing to review some Python before approaching this text, I recommend \link{https://jakevdp.github.io/WhirlwindTourOfPython/}{\emph{A Whirlwind Tour of Python}} and \link{https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/}{\emph{Python Data Science Handbook}}, both by Jake VanderPlas.

%Because this is \emph{Matplotlib for Haters}, I assume some exposure to matplotlib so that I won't explain the most basic constructions.
