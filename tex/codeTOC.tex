\noindent All code and data files are available on the book's \link{https://github.com/alexanderthclark/Matplotlib-for-Storytellers}{GitHub repository}. Note I exclude imports from the Python files in the main text. The imports below should cover the entire text. All of these should be included if you installed Anaconda, except for the ternary library, which I comment out below. When saving figures, I also sometimes run \code{plt.tight_layout()}, which is not always included in the Python files. See \texttt{Prose-Figure-Dev.ipynb}, \texttt{Math-Interlude-Figure-Dev.iypnb}, \texttt{Special-Figure-Dev.iypnb}, and \texttt{Poetry-Figure-Dev.iypnb} which contain the complete code for every figure.
